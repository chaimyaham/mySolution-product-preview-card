### What I learned

my major learning while i wa working through this project is the css variables

```css
:root{
    --Dark-cyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
    --Cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
    --Very-dark-blue: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
    --button-hover: hsl(159, 37%, 20%);
    --Dark-grayish-blue: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --fz:14px;
    --ff-fraunces: 'Fraunces', serif;
    --ff-montserrat: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
}

```

### Continued development
